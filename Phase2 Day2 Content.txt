                                                         DATA STRUCTURES
*Helps to write efficient programs
LINEAR-array/linked list/stack/queue/matrix
NON-LINEAR-binary tree/heap/hash table/graph
Linear -Storing data sequentially
Lon-linear-No sequential style required


l -array,linked list,stack,queue
nl -trees,graphs,tables,sets
***DS-Linear and non linear
          linear-Static(fixed size) and dynamic(not fixed size)
                    static-array 
                   dynamic-list,stack,queue
          non-linear -graph,tree


            LINKED LISTS   
 Example:Train 
*As the name says list of items which are linked with one another is called as linked list 
Types-Single linked list,Double linked list,Circular linked list 

CREATING LINKED LIST:
step-1:create the node 
step-2:partition the node with two segments data and none
step-3:add value into the blank node 
step-4:mark the node as head
step-5:create the next node by following the above steps
step-6:establish link between first node and second node

DISPLAYING LINKED LIST:
Traversal is required from first node till _____ node in order to display existing linked list

OPERATIONS:
1.INSERT
	beginning
	end
	position
2.DELETE
3.SEARCH
