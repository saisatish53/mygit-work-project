                          *GRAPHS*           
Adjacency:Connection should be there
Path:There should be a route
Types of Graphs:
	1.Undirected graph
	2.Directed graph
	3.Weigh graph
Representation of graphs:
	1.List of edges
	2.Adjacent List
	3.Adjacent Matrix

*BFS: In Breadth First Search, visit a node and then move on to all adjacent vertices whereas in 
      DFS(Depth First Search),after visiting a node, select one adjacent vertex and explore it completely move on 
	with other vertices or vertex.
*DIJKSTRA ALGORITHM:
1.It comes under greedy method where solution for the given problem
  will be figured out stage by stage
2.Dijkstra algo helps you to find out shortest path or distance from one vertex
  to all the other vertices
Drawback: If weight of any edge is a negative number,Dijkstra wont work for that
