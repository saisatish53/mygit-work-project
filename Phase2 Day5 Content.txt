Types of trees:
  1.Binary tree:A node can have maximum 2 children
	*Binary tree traversal:
		1.In order      ----> left-root-right       -->LDR
		2.pre order   ----> root-left-right        -->DLR
		3.post order  ---->   left-right-root      -->LRD
		where L is left,R is right,D is data or root
	Types of Binary tree:
		1.Full binary tree
		2.Degenerate or pathological tree
		3.Skewed binary tree
			i.Left Skewed
			ii.Right Skewed
		4.Complete binary tree:
			i.Every level shold be fuull or complete
			ii.In last level,if it is incomplete,nodes should present at extreme left side
		5.Perfect binary tree:
			i.All internal nodes which has two children and leaf nodes both should be at same level
            6.Balanced tree:
			For all the nodes , (height of left sub tree - height of right sub tree) can be 0 or 1
		7.Binary Search Tree:
			i.All the left side elements should be lesser than its parent
			ii.All the right side elements should be greater than its parent
