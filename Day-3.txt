#sets
s.add() add element
s.update() add to more elements
s.discard() delete the element
s.remove() same as discard but show the error
s1={1,2,3}
s2={4,5,6,1,2}
s1|s2 union    s1.union(s2)
    {1,2,3,4,5,6}
s1&s2 intersect   s1.intersection(s2)
     we have symmetric with ^ or s1.symmetric_difference(s2)
# Dictonary
tuple has count and index
count has elements no.of occurrences
index has tells the place ofnthe element
